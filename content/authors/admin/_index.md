I'm a first-year MS student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/). I received a BA in Statistics from [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/) in May 2023.

Outside of work, I love downhill skiing, drinking coconut water and fruit tea, listening to EDM/K-POP, and dancing. But on top of all, I love reflecting about life and enjoy it.
