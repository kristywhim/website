I'm a second-year master's student at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/). I received a B.A. in Statistics from [Macalester College](https://www.macalester.edu/) (with minors in Biology and Computer Science) in May 2023. Currently, I am a lab member of [Li Lab](https://github.com/li-lab-genetics) where I am honored to work with [Dr. Xihao Li](https://xihaoli.org) and other wonderful peers for novel statistical methods that contribute to detecting rare-variant set association by variants' annotation information ([STAAR](https://github.com/xihaoli/STAAR)). My current job is to develop computational add-on customizations to [STAARpipeline](https://github.com/xihaoli/STAARpipeline), an R workflow that performs rare variant-set test for association in whole-genome sequencing studies from TOPMed database.

Outside of work, I like downhill skiing (I can play up to black diamond!), choreography (urban dance, K-pop, jazz mostly), lighting up scented candles (woody or tea tone), drinking coconut water and white tea. I was an ex-athelete in badminton but it has been 8 years I haven't played it. But on top of all these, visit my blog website [here](https://thoughtful-whim.netlify.app/en).
